# Implication

| A | B | A â‡’ B |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |  T    |
| T | F |  F    |
| F | T |  T    |
| F | F |  T    |


A is something that promises B
- if you achieve A and B happens then the implication is true
- if you achieve A and B doesn't happen, implication is false
- if you don't achieve A and B doesn't happen, implication is true
- if you dont' achieve A and B does happen, implication is still true
    - implication says nothing about B occuring being dependent on A
    - B can occur regardless of A
