**Leavening Agent**
    - causes foaming action that lightens and softens
    - incorporates gas bubbles into dough
    ### Chemical Leveners
        - mixtures or compounds that release gases when they react with each other, moisture, or heat
        - after reaction leave behind chemical salt
    ### Other Leaveners
        - steam or air used when they expand upon heatin
        - requires high temps to flash water to steam
        - i.e. popovers, yorkshire puddings
    ### Mechanical Leavening
        - *Creaming* - beating sugar crystals and solid fat together in mixer
            - integrates tiny air bubbles into mixture
                - sugar crystals physically cut through structure of fat
        - *Whisk* - cream or egg whites, creates foam through mechanical action
            - spong cakes


**Fats**
    - tenderize by coating and weakening gluten bonds within structure
    - illusion of wetness, do not evaporate or become absorbed with heat like water does
    - help move heat through product
    ### Butter
        - contains water
            - turns to steam during baking, assists in leavening
        - best at room temperature
    ### Oils
        - completely fat, no water

**Eggs**
    - protein helps with structure
    - when mixed, form web that traps in moistures and fats
    - proteins can create tiny air bubbles that group together in a foam
        - when baked foam expands and creates rise
    - emulsify fats and liquids, thickeners, binding agents, help with browning

**Baking Soda**
    - needs an acid present to work
        - i.e. citrus, buttermilk, yogurt, sour cream, vinegar, molasses, honey, chocolate


**Baking Powder**
    -  contains the acid

**Sugar**
    - tenderizes by weakening gluten strands
    - leavener through creaming
    - feeds yeast, and enables to grow
